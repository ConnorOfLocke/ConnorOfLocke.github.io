						<p> To preface and if you haven't seen or played Token, It's is a hex grid game where the aim is to get your token to designated end hexes by moving one hex at a time and then placing a wall between two other hexes</p>
						<br>
						<p>Simple in concept and much like checkers or any board game, every player has all information at all times. But it's got some caveats in their plenty.</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Part 1 - Representing the board</h2>
						<br>
						<p> Before we start putting AI routines, rules and whatever else you need, you first need a way to store a single game in it's entirety. </p>
						<br>
						<p> Much like chess or whatever you need you can store it as a array of values and save exactly which value is which</p>
						<br>
						<p> This would work except we ain't using an exact square grid. I came across <a class = "highlighted" href = "http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/" target = "_blank">this website<a> which is incredibly usefull for working with hex grids.</p>
